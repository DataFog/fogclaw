## Design Principles
- Clarity over cleverness; make the primary action obvious.
- Consistency beats novelty; reuse patterns unless there is a strong reason not to.
- Accessible by default (contrast, focus, keyboard).

## Visual Direction
- Use design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) to keep the UI cohesive.
- Prefer a small, intentional palette and a consistent type scale.

## Interaction Standards
- Every async action has loading, success, and error states with clear messaging.
- Forms validate inline and preserve user input; errors explain how to recover.
