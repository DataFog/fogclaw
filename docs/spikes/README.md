# Spikes

Time-boxed investigations for uncertain/risky initiatives.
Use the pattern `docs/spikes/<slug>-spike.md`.

Spike docs should start with YAML frontmatter (see `docs/PLANS.md` for the artifact contract).

Recommended sections: `Context`, `Validation Goal`, `Approach`, `Findings`, `Decisions`, `Recommendation`, `Impact on Upstream Docs`, `Spike Code`, `Remaining Unknowns`, `Time Spent`, and append-only `Revision Notes`.
