title: "Product Sense"
use_when: "Capturing target users, success outcomes, decision heuristics, and quality criteria for this repo."
---

## Target Users
- Name the primary user and the primary job-to-be-done; list any secondary users explicitly.
- Call out non-users (who this is not for) to reduce scope creep.

## Key Outcomes
- Define 1-3 outcomes that matter and how you will measure them (even if qualitative).
- Prefer metrics tied to user time, reliability, and task completion.

## Decision Heuristics
- Prefer shipping a smaller, complete slice over a broad, partial feature.
- Optimize for reducing user effort and reducing operational burden.

## Quality Criteria
- Clear error messages and recovery paths; no silent failures.
- Sensible defaults and empty states; predictable navigation.
