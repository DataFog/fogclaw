# Changelog

## 0.4.0

### Fixed

- **Tool registration matches the OpenClaw plugin contract** — all 6 tools were registered with `schema:`/`handler:`, which the runtime does not recognize; tool calls failed before reaching the model. Tools now register with `parameters:` and `execute(toolCallId, params)`. Discovered in E2E testing (PR #3), verified against current upstream docs.
- **Outbound redaction stays on the regex path** (#4, thanks @hanhuihanhui) — `message_sending` now uses regex-only scanning to keep reply delivery fast, consistent with the tool-result path. Also removes an undeclared direct import of `@xenova/transformers`.

### Added

- **SECRET and TOKEN detection** (#4) — assigned credentials (`client_secret=…`, `password: …`) and tokens (`api_key=…`, `Bearer …`) are now detected and redacted by the regex engine.
- **`contracts.tools` manifest declaration** — the six FogClaw tools are declared in `openclaw.plugin.json`, required for tool discovery in current OpenClaw.
- **`openclaw.compat` metadata** in `package.json` (`pluginApi >=2026.3.24-beta.2`); Node engine floor raised to 22.19.

### Security

- **Allowlist hardening** (ported from datafog-python 4.7.0) — patterns must match the full entity text, so a partial match never suppresses a finding; quantified groups containing nested quantifiers (e.g. `(a+)+`) are rejected at config time to prevent catastrophic backtracking on attacker-influenced entity text; patterns are capped at 512 chars; entities longer than 512 chars skip pattern matching fail-safe (the finding is kept).
- **Dependency vulnerabilities cleared** — `npm audit` reported 10 vulnerabilities (2 critical); now 0. protobufjs/rollup/tar transitives fixed, vitest 2→4, sharp 0.34.5→0.35.3.

### Changed (OpenClaw 2026.6.11 compatibility)

- **Typed against the real plugin SDK** — `openclaw` 2026.6.11 is now a devDependency; the entry point uses `definePluginEntry` with `OpenClawPluginApi`, and tool schemas are TypeBox objects (`typebox` pinned to OpenClaw's vendored 1.1.39). Verified: the plugin loads, registers, and attaches all hooks in a live isolated-profile `openclaw plugins list` / `doctor` run.
- **Inbound guardrail migrated** from deprecated `before_agent_start` to `before_prompt_build`.
- **Hard blocking via `before_agent_run`** — when block actions are configured, FogClaw now stops the run outright instead of only injecting a block instruction. Requires `plugins.entries.fogclaw.hooks.allowConversationAccess: true`; falls back to the prompt-level instruction when unavailable.
- **`reply_payload_sending` hook added** — media captions and normalized payload text do not always flow through `message_sending`; this closes that outbound gap.
- **Shared allowlist matcher** (`src/allowlist.ts`) — the tool-result path had a duplicate of the pre-hardening allowlist logic, so partial pattern matches could still suppress findings there. Both paths now share fullmatch anchoring and the 512-char fail-safe subject cap. Allowlist patterns now anchor on the tool-result path too: a prefix pattern like `^internal-` must become `^internal-.*`.

### Security (continued)

- **`fogclaw_redact` and `fogclaw_preview` no longer return the placeholder→original mapping** in model-visible tool output — returning it partially defeated redaction (the mapping persisted in the session transcript). `fogclaw_redact` now feeds the mapping into `RedactionMapStore` and returns the placeholder list; originals are recoverable only through the access-request backlog (`fogclaw_request_access` → user approval via `fogclaw_resolve`).

### Changed (live E2E findings)

- **Inbound guardrail messaging made honest.** A live agent-turn E2E (openclaw 2026.6.11, real Anthropic call) showed the model receives BOTH the prepended "redacted message" and the original prompt — `prependContext` cannot remove the original, and the plugin API has no prompt-rewrite hook (verified against every hook signature). The old wording ("The following is the user's message with PII redacted") was misleading and visibly confused the model. Inbound context now says what is true: it flags entity types, instructs the agent to use placeholders, and provides the placeholder reference. Enforced protection is: `before_agent_run` block gate (live-verified: run stopped before any model call), tool-result rewriting, and outbound delivery rewriting.
- Live E2E also confirmed: GLiNER loads and detects in-process (zero-shot labels appear alongside regex hits), and outbound hooks (`message_sending`/`reply_payload_sending`) fire only on channel delivery — CLI `--local` runs without `--deliver` do not exercise them.

### Known follow-ups

- Live end-to-end agent turn (gateway + real provider) exercising all four hook layers; rebuild the E2E baseline from closed PR #3 against the current runtime.
- onnxruntime pins unchanged: gliner 0.0.19 (latest) expects onnxruntime 1.19.x internals; revisit when gliner updates.
- `fogclaw_scan`/`fogclaw_preview` still return detected entity spans (including matched text) for caller-supplied input; unlike the mapping this reveals nothing the caller did not already have, but consider a count-only output mode for transcript hygiene.

## 0.3.0

### Added

- **PII access request backlog** — agents can request access to redacted data via `fogclaw_request_access`, users review via `fogclaw_requests`, and resolve (approve/deny/follow-up) via `fogclaw_resolve`. Full async workflow with batch resolve support.
- **RedactionMapStore** — captures placeholder-to-original text mappings from all three scanning hooks, enabling backlog approvals to reveal original data.
- **Configurable `maxPendingRequests`** — caps the number of pending access requests per session (default: 50). Configurable in `fogclaw.config.json` and `openclaw.plugin.json`.
- **FIFO eviction for redaction mappings** — `RedactionMapStore` caps at 10,000 entries by default with oldest-first eviction to prevent unbounded PII accumulation in memory.
- **Access request audit events** — `access_request_created` and `access_request_resolved` structured audit log entries when `auditEnabled: true`. Never includes raw PII.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — top-level architecture document covering components, scanning layers, tools, data flow, and key invariants.

## 0.2.0

### Added

- **Tool result PII scanning** — new `tool_result_persist` hook scans file reads, API responses, and web fetches for PII before they enter the session transcript. Uses regex engine (sync) for <1ms latency on the hot path.
- **Outbound message PII scanning** — new `message_sending` hook provides a last-chance gate that catches PII in agent replies before delivery to Telegram, Slack, Discord, and other external channels. Uses full Scanner (regex + GLiNER).
- **Policy allowlist** — whitelist exact strings, regex patterns, or per-entity-type values to skip enforcement on known-safe content (e.g., `noreply@example.com`).
- **Per-entity confidence thresholds** — tune GLiNER detection sensitivity per label (e.g., require 0.7 for PERSON, 0.85 for ORGANIZATION).
- **Audit trail logging** — structured audit log entries with `source` field (`guardrail`, `tool_result`, `outbound`) when `auditEnabled: true`. Logs entity counts and labels without raw PII.
- **Policy preview tool** — `fogclaw_preview` shows which entities would be blocked, warned, or redacted without changing runtime behavior.
- **Scanning architecture documentation** — README now includes a comparison matrix showing engine trade-offs across all three hooks.
- **Control UI hints** — `openclaw.plugin.json` includes `uiHints` for policy configuration in OpenClaw's Control UI.

### Changed

- `resolveAction` extracted to shared `types.ts` module (was duplicated across files).
- README updated with three-layer scanning overview and defense-in-depth flow diagram.

## 0.1.6

Initial scoped release as `@datafog/fogclaw`.

- Dual-engine PII detection (regex + GLiNER via ONNX)
- `before_agent_start` hook for automatic prompt guardrail
- `fogclaw_scan` and `fogclaw_redact` tools
- Configurable per-entity actions (`redact`, `block`, `warn`)
- Multiple redaction strategies (`token`, `mask`, `hash`)
- Custom entity types via GLiNER zero-shot NER
- Graceful degradation to regex-only when GLiNER unavailable
